Magento API client
===

> **Note**: This client has been generated by [Jane](https://github.com/janephp/janephp).

To manage the searchCriteria allowed by the option resolver, we have added some generator in the bin directory.

The search-criteria-generate is used by the jane-openapi-generate and generate the searchCriteria parameters with 10 filterGroups and 10 Filters in each group and stored this in the parameters.json file.

The parameters-list-generate must be used before the jane-openapi-generate to update the schema.json file with references to the parameters.json.

This is the endpoint list we have edit on our schema.json to use the generated searchCriteria :
